## Linux enviroment
### How to run the program in Linux:

## Linux/Ubuntu/Java installation
#### 
1. Install Ubuntu: Ubuntu can be installed by PowerShell.
2. Use the (wsl -- install ) designation, (The Windows Subsystem for Linux),to install a Linux distribution (Such as, Ubuntu).
3. When Ubuntu installation is complete. Create a "Username" and a "password".
4. In Ubuntu check if java is installed and which version of java is downloaded. Use designation (java -version) to examine if the java program already exist and which version is available on the computer.
5. If java do not exist: Use distro/package manager: Use designation (sudo apt-get update) "Then you need to enter password for Ubuntu, to make the download completed".
6. Next designation to type in is: (sudo apt install openjdk-19-jdk-headless). You can install more types of java versions by enter

## Commands and intro in ubuntu:
## How to run a program in linux:
####
1. The use designation (clear) to delete the recent text on the screen. Making the Ubuntu environment more present to work in "without distractions".
2. Commando `(ls)` is used for list all the "maps" and "katalogs" in the folder we are in.
3. Commando `(pwd)` point out where we stand! In which folder. 
4. Commando `(cd)` "change directory"
5. Commando `(cd)` with a `(/)`: --> `(cd /)` where `(/)` means the root, so with command basically takes you to the c-drive in windows. "As far out as possible".
6. Then in Ubuntu the standard directory/search-way will change, this will upper (yourUsername@Laptop-G8HVHR4T:/$). This is the standard directory "yourUsername@Laptop-G8HVHR4T:~$".
7. Afterward type in ls then you will receive all the folders in your root catalog.
8. Give commando `(cd)` once again to make the search-way get back to standar "Not root search". Standard = "`yourUsername@Laptop-G8HVHR4T:~$`".
9. `(mkdir)` = "`Make directory`". 
10. Give commando `(mkdir java_program_1)` then enter. If nothing happens then the mkdir its completed.
11. Give command `(ls)`!
12. The `(ls)` result should be java_program_1!
13. Congrats you have now created a map!
14. Give commando `(cd java_program_1/)` to jump into the file!
15. The `(cd java_program_1/)` result would be `~/java_program_1$`
16. NOW ARE YOU READY TO RUN A JAVA PROGRAM IN LINUX!
17. The latest result `~/java_program_1$` Give commando `(nanao)`! nano is a text editing program. After nano a filename or chose a filename if it exists. `(~/java_program_1$ nano HelloWorld.java)`.
18. Then you have created a platform to write your java program and run it. It will pop up a window.
19. When you write the java code it needs to be exact, to be abel to run.
20.  For example write `("Hello world")`.
21. Afterward you have different options on the lower part of the screen. Chose option `(^X for exit)`. Klick and hold --> `(Ctrl + X)`!
22. Then klick enter for YES! Then the file name will upper and just click enter to continue.
23. Use commando `(nano cat HelloWorld.java)` then press enter!
24. What will upper on the screen is the full code printed.
25. If you want to change the name of the file you can use command `(mv HelloWorld.java HelloWorld_1 )`. 
26. You have now changed the file name.
## Compile the program:
